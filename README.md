This is the R code for the paper:

Lee SH, Kao GD, Feigenberg SJ, et al. Multi-block discriminant analysis of integrative 18F-FDG-PET/CT radiomics for predicting circulating tumor cells in early stage non-small cell lung cancer treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics. 2021. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2021.02.030.

This example code does not provide input datasets and is written based on the assumption that you have two different CT and PET radiomics feature sets. Input your omics datasets to 'X' and binary outcome data to 'Y' to run this code.
